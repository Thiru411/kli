                    one can calculate Compound Interest by subtracting the principal from the amount.You can calculate the compound interest using this formula: CI = P(1 + r / n) nt - P
                    Here,
                    A is the final amount.

                    r is the rate of interest.
                    n is the number of times the interest is increased yearly.
                    t is the overall tenure.

                    current interest rate offered on PPF is around 7.1% (interest rate - r) compounded annually (n = 1).

                                    Generally, daily compounding is more beneficial than monthly compounding as it allows your money to grow faster. With daily compounding, interest is calculated and added to your principal balance every
                                    day, maximizing growth potential.

                                    Compound interest investments are a type of investment where the interest earned on the principal amount is added to the principal. Then the interest is calculated on the new total. In other words,
                                    instead of earning interest only on the initial investment, the investor earns interest on the accumulated total, which includes the principal and the interest earned on it.

                                    The effective annual interest rate is a financial concept that represents the total amount of interest that is earned or paid on a loan or investment over the course of one year, expressed as a percentage
                                    of the original principal. It is also sometimes referred to as the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) or the Effective Interest Rate (EIR).

                                    The effective annual interest rate takes into account the compounding of interest, which is the process of earning interest on both the principal amount and any previously earned interest. When interest
                                    is compounded, the interest that is earned in each period is added to the principal amount, and the interest for the next period is calculated based on the new total

                                    Compound interest offers several benefits, including exponential growth of wealth, the ability to reach long-term financial goals faster, and the potential to accumulate significant savings over time.
                                    It's a powerful tool for wealth creation and long-term financial planning.

                                    Your interest is typically compounded based on the terms of the financial product or investment you have. Compounding is the process by which the interest you earn on an investment is added to your
                                    principal balance, and then interest is calculated on the new total. This means that over time, your earnings can grow exponentially due to the effect of compounding.

                                    The primary difference between simple interest and compound interest is that simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount, while compound interest is calculated on the principal amount as
                                    well as the accumulated interest over time, resulting in faster growth of the investment.
