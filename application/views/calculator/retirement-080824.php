                    <p class="compoundInterestWorks-desc">Inflation can have a significant impact on retirement savings, eroding the purchasing power of money over time. It essential for retirees to account for inflation when planning their financial future. Failure to do so can result in a shortfall of funds during retirement, potentially leading to financial insecurity and an inability to maintain one's desired standard of living.

                            <li class="listTerms-lists light"><b>Requires higher savings:</b>  Retirees may need to save more to maintain their standard of living in retirement, factoring in the impact of inflation over the long term.</li>
