                    one can calculate Compound Interest by subtracting the principal from the amount.You can calculate the compound interest using this formula: CI = P(1 + r / n) nt - P

                    A is the final amount.

                    n is the number of times the interest is increased yearly.

                <p class="whatIsCompountInterest-desc">A compound interest calculator is an online tool that helps you determine the potential earnings on an investment based on a set of parameters, such as the initial principal, the interest rate, and the compounding period. Most compound interest formulas use a simple interface that allows you to input the values, and then it does the calculations for you.

          <div class="compoundInterestWorks">
            <h2 class="compoundInterestWorks-title mb10">How do Compound Interest Calculators Work?</h2>
            <p class="compoundInterestWorks-desc">To understand how compound interest is calculated, let us consider an example.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="compoundInterestWorks-desc">Suppose you invest ₹1,000 in an account that earns 5% annual interest. In the first year, you would earn ₹50 in interest, bringing the total value of your investment to ₹1,050. In the second year, you would earn interest not only on the original ₹1,000 but also on the ₹50 in interest earned in the first year. This means that the interest earned in the second year would be ₹52.50 (5% of ₹1,050), bringing the total value of your investment to ₹1,102.50. As you can see, the interest earned in each period is added to the principal amount, leading to an increase in the interest earned in subsequent periods.</p>
            <h3 class="compoundInterestWorks-subtitle">The compound interest formula is as follows:</h3>
            <div class="compoundInterestWorks-box">
              <div class="compoundInterestWorks-formula">A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)</div>
              <ul class="listTerms">
                <li>Where:</li>
                <li class="listTerms-lists">A = the final amount</li>
                <li class="listTerms-lists">P = the principal amount</li>
                <li class="listTerms-lists">r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)</li>
                <li class="listTerms-lists">n = the number of times the interest is compounded per year</li>
                <li class="listTerms-lists">t = the number of years</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="compoundInterestWorks-desc mt20">Let us use this formula to calculate the value of an investment after 5 years, starting with a principal amount of ₹1,000, an annual interest rate of 5%, and interest compounded annually.
</div>
            <br>
            <div class="compoundInterestWorks-variable">A = 1000(1 + 0.05/1)^(1x5) <br> A = ₹1,276.28</div>
            <div class="compoundInterestWorks-desc">The value of the investment after 5 years with compound interest is ₹1,276.28, which is higher than the value of the investment with simple interest formula, which would be ₹1,250. This is because, with compound interest, interest is earned not only on the principal amount but also on the accumulated interest, leading to a higher overall return on the investment.

At its core, compounding is the ability of an investment to generate earnings on both the principal amount and the accumulated interest over time. This concept is often referred to as the "snowball effect" because as the earnings accumulate, the investment grows exponentially, much like a snowball rolling down a hill.</p>

                    <p>Compound interest investments are a type of investment where the interest earned on the principal amount is added to the principal, and then the interest is calculated on the new total. In other words, instead of earning interest only on the initial investment, the investor earns interest on the accumulated total, which includes the principal and the interest earned on it.</p>

                  <div class="accordDesc" style="display: none;">
                    <p>The effective annual interest rate is a financial concept that represents the total amount of interest that is earned or paid on a loan or investment over the course of one year, expressed as a percentage of the original principal. It is also sometimes referred to as the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) or the Effective Interest Rate (EIR).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The effective annual interest rate takes into account the compounding of interest, which is the process of earning interest on both the principal amount and any previously earned interest. When interest is compounded, the interest that is earned in each period is added to the principal amount, and the interest for the next period is calculated based on the new total</p>

                    <p>Your interest is typically compounded based on the terms of the financial product or investment you have. Compounding is the process by which the interest you earn on an investment is added to your principal balance, and then interest is calculated on the new total. This means that over time, your earnings can grow exponentially due to the effect of compounding.</p>
