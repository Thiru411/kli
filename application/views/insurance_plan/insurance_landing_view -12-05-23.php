		<h2 class="h2bold">How does a life insurance policy work?</h2>

			<ul class="bullet">
				<li><b>What is life insurance:</b>It is the pledge from your insurance provider to pay a specified amount to your beneficiary in case of an unfortunate incidence. In return, you pay a pre-decided premium to the insurance provider. Paying premiums on a regular basis or all at once at the time of purchase is essential to keep the policy in force.</li>
				<li><b>How the insurers decide the premium:</b> Through the process of underwriting, the insurer assesses risks involved in insuring your life. They ensure that the cost of the life cover they propose matches the risk they face in providing the coverage. For this reason, they put forward a detailed questionnaire about your health status and your workplace conditions. You may have to undergo a medical examination as well. The insurers set thebest life insurancepremium for you accordingly. Also, life risks amplify with age and premiums cost more when your age increases.</li>
				<li><b>When to pay the premium:</b>You can opt to pay the premium upfront when youbuy life insurance.You can also pay on a monthly, yearly, half-yearly, or quarterly basis depending on the terms of your policy.</li>
				<li><b>How your beneficiary receives the benefits:</b>If an unwanted event happens, your nominated recipient must file a claim with a duly filled intimation form and the original policy document. The insurance company verifies the claim validity in line with the policy terms. If everything is in order, the insurer releases the stipulated payout.</li>
				<li><b>When insurers can reject claims:</b> Suppressed or false information in the application form or a lapsed policy can be causes for refusal.</li>
				<li><b>How term insurance works:</b> The life cover lasts for the period defined at purchase. Your nominee receives the sum stated in the policy when you meet an untoward outcome. There is no cash value, and if you survive the policy term, the insurer makes no payment. It is the most inexpensive form of life insurance providing sizeable life coverage at premiums that fit your budget.</li>
				<li><b>How traditional life insurance works: </b>The sum assured is defined at inception. However, such policies acquire a cash value with time since a part of the premium earns interest, and the insurer shares the profit with you. You can access this amount as regular incomes during the policy period or let it accumulate up to maturity. If an unwanted event occurs, your family received the death benefits.</li>
				<li><b>How unit-linked life insurance works:</b> The sum assured is not fixed. The insurer invests your premium in the capital market. You can choose the funds where your money goes based on your risk appetite, and market performance decides the final yields. Thus, suchlife insurance planspresent the potential for substantial profits. Moreover, your nominee receives a payout in case of an untimely loss.</li>
			</ul>
<h2 class="h2bold">How to choose the perfect life insurance policy and coverage for you?</h2>
<ul class="bullet">
	<li><b>Work out the coverage type best suitable for you.</b>Before buying, it is vital to determine the goals that you plan to achieve through this financial tool. Once you identify the needs, it will be simpler to choose thebest life insurance policythat covers the essential aspects.</li>
	<ul class="buleet">
		<li>If you need coverage that generates liquidity, you can consider an investment insurance policy that acquires surrender value. You can take loans or partially withdraw funds from it.</li>
		<li>A money-back plan may work well for you if you have specific time frames for your short-term life goals.</li>
		<li>An income plan can act as a source of income after your regular wages stop.</li>
		<li>Those who are in the lookout for quick profits and do not have hefty financial liabilities can invest in market-linked insurance.</li>
		<li>If you wish to protect your retirement corpus and make decent profits, you can buy non-participating policies with guaranteed returns.</li>
		<li>In case your primary goal involves protecting your family from financial duress, term insurance can be thebest life insurance plansfor you.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>Determine how long you need life protection.</b></li>
	<p>The duration for which your family will need financial assistance should be your ideal policy term. For example:</p>
	<ul class="bullet">
		<li>You may need insurance for a defined period, for instance, until the time your children acquire financial independence or for the duration of your home loan. In this case, term insurance would be appropriate.</li>
		<li>Otherwise, if you have to provide for financial dependents up to an advanced age, you can consider wholelife insurance. It can act as a source of income for your spouse.</li>
		<li>For pension planning, you can count the number of years until your retirement and select a limited premium payment term accordingly.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>Calculate your ideal sum assured.</b></li>
		<p>You can estimate this value through the following steps:</p>
		<ul class="bullet">
			<li>Review your family’s current living costs</li>
			<li>Gauge how long your dependents may require income replacement</li>
			<li>Multiply the two values</li>
			<li>Add your outstanding debts, e.g. house mortgage, car loans, existing student loans, credit card dues, etc. to the product</li>
			<li>Include the expected expenses for your children’s education or other long-term expenditure you can foresee.</li>
			<li>Deduct the value of your existing investments</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You will arrive at a ballpark figure for the coverage you need.</p>
		<p>Do keep in mind that inflation may erode your money’s worth. Nevertheless, insurance plans with investment elements, especially policies linked to the capital market can deliver inflation-beating revenues. Another economical option is to opt for term insurance that offers the flexibility to upgrade the life cover with changing circumstances.</p>
		<li><b>Select according to your budget.</b></li>
<p>The cost of the coverage is another vital consideration that affects your policy choice. You can research online for thebest life insurancequotes.</p>

<li><b>Customize your coverage with riders.</b></li>
<p> For a nominal cost, you can club with your basic sum assured extra coverage against financial exigencies.
For example, if you work in a high-risk profession, an accidental death benefit can be useful. It will provide extra payouts to your family if you meet an accident.
Likewise, if you have a family history of critical ailments, you can buy a critical illness rider. It offers payouts if you contract a life-threatening health condition covered under the plan.</p>
<li><b>Consult a life insurance advisor.</b></li>
<p>An expert can help you analyze the potential worth of your preferred policies and guide you towards thebest life insurancepolicyfor your needs. Reputed insurance companies offer the assistance of in-house advisors. You can discuss your requirements with them before making the final selection.</p>

Even if you have just started to earn, you need to assemble funds for future goals and old age expenses. Life insurance costs increase with age.

"acceptedAnswer": {

"@type": "Answer",

"text": "You can appoint as your nominee anyone you want to benefit from the life insurance funds. The general practice is to assign your close relatives like children, spouse, or parents. But, to secure your family’s finances, you need to evaluate the accountability of the person you choose. You can select multiple beneficiaries as well. Moreover, if you want to nominate children below age 18, you have to appoint a custodian. The appointee will receive the payout unless the minor attains adulthood. However, nominating an unrelated person who will not suffer any hardship from the loss of your income can be hazardous. Thus, insurance companies may refuse such a nominee."
