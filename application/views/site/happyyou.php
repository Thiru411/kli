<h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Wellbeing is not just about what you eat and drink but also about what you surround yourself
with. Keeping this in mind, we have created an app that will take care of all your wellbeing
needs.</p>
        <p>Our app is called HappyYou because that&#39;s our objective – to help you achieve a happy, healthy,
and balanced life. We want to fundamentally shape the way you live. With HappyYou, you can
take control of your life and elevate it to a whole new level.</p>
        <p>Yes, making changes to your lifestyle can be hard, and sometimes you may feel not motivated
enough to take the right step. This is where our mascot, Ko-B, the HappyYou bear, comes in
handy. Ko-B is your friend, companion, and guide. He embodies strength, resilience and
playfulness that are essential components of overall wellbeing.</p>
			
		<p>We also believe in the power of community – you can share your journey with your loved ones.
You can invite them to be a part of your support network and also help them thrive.</p>
		<p>So, what are you waiting for?</p>
        <p>It’s time. To embark on a new adventure. To rediscover yourself. To unveil a new you.</p>
