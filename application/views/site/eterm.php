	  						<h3 class="text-center fs-size">WHAT IS TERM INSURANCE?</h3>
	  						<p>Term insurance is a cost-effective life insurance that covers you (policyholder) for a predefined period. It offers substantial financial security to dependents or beneficiaries in your absence by providing them with financial coverage in exchange for regular payments. At an elementary level, it involves paying small amounts (paid monthly/quarterly/half-yearly/annually) called premiums. Once the policy matures, you receive returns that you may have earned over the years, depending on the type of term insurance policy you chose. You can pay the fixed premiums at once or in instalments over the policy's term or for a specific period. However, one noteworthy fact is that if the policy's tenure ends while you are still alive, then neither you nor your beneficiaries receive any money. </p>

	  				<h3 class="text-center fs-size">WHY DO YOU NEED A TERM INSURANCE PLAN?</h3><br>
	  				<p>You cannot predict life's uncertainty at any time, and unfortunate events can leave your loved ones without financial security, forcing them to rely on a close relative or compelling your spouse and children to seek new income sources to support the family. To avoid such a situation, a term insurance plan plays a role of utmost significance in securing your loved ones and their future in your absence.</p><br>
  				<p>Consider this:</p>

                <p>You are the only earning member of a family of four with a monthly expense of ₹50,000. Your spouse is a homemaker, your younger one is completing their primary education, while the elder child will soon begin college. If you pass away in an unfortunate event, your family still requires the same amount to manage their expenses. They will have to rely on others due to a lack of financial backing. However, if you own a term insurance plan, your family can lead a self-sufficient life, and your children can finish their education without worry.</p><br>
                
                <p>Term plans provide a lump sum payment to protect your loved ones and meet all their necessities. From your children's education to paying off any loans, the death benefit amount can help your loved ones manage their financial needs.</p><br>
                
                <p>In a nutshell, you can say that you need a term plan to:</p><br>
                <ul class="bullet">
                    <li>Secure your family’s future and their financial security</li>
                    <li>Shield yourself from lifestyle related risks and health issues with the use of riders</li>
                    <li>Protect your assets against any future financial liability</li>
                    <li>Support your loved ones even when you are not around</li>

  							<p class="text-center">The complex jargon and technical terms used in term insurance policies overwhelm a majority of individuals. Therefore, it is critical to understand such terminologies to make an informed choice when purchasing insurance. The following is a glossary of some of the most regularly used terms in term life insurance contracts.</p>
  						</div>

	  							</figure>
	  							<h2 class="h2-sec">Policyholder</h2>
	  							<p>The person who owns the policy is also known as the policy owner. The policyholder is the one who purchases the insurance and pays the premiums regularly.</p>
	  						</div>
  						</div>
  						<div class="custom_card">

	  							</figure>
	  							<h2 class="h2-sec">Life Assured</h2>
	  							<p>It is the individual for whom the insurance is purchased. However, the life assured and the policyholder may or may not be the same. For example, if you buy life insurance for yourself, you will be the policyholder and the life assured. However, if you get insurance for your spouse and pay the monthly premiums, you will be the policyholder, and your spouse will be life assured.</p>

	  							</figure>
	  							<h2 class="h2-sec">Nominee</h2>
	  							<p>If the life assured passes away during the policy term, the nominee or beneficiary is the person who inherits the sum insured. According to the nomination rules governed by Section 39 of the Insurance Act, 1938, being a legal heir does not automatically make anyone a nominee. The person has to be assigned by the policyholder in time of purchasing the cover or at a later stage. Generally, children, spouses, parents, and siblings can be chosen as nominees.</p>

	  							</figure>
	  							<h2 class="h2-sec">Sum Assured</h2>
	  							<p>It is the amount paid to the nominee by the insurance company upon the death of the life assured. For example, you obtain a term life insurance policy for yourself and name your spouse as the beneficiary. Before purchasing, you will be requested to set a sum assured. Let's say the sum assured is ₹1 crore. Then, if you pass away during the policy term, your spouse will receive the sum insured of ₹1 crore from the insurance firm.</p>

	  							<h2 class="h2-sec">Policy Term</h2>
	  							<p>It is the tenure or duration of the insurance coverage that is active or valid. This period can range from a year to a lifetime, depending on the policy condition. For example, consider the instance of 40-year insurance coverage. The insurance firm is subject to pay the sum assured to the nominee if the life assured passes away during this term. The term "policy tenure" is commonly used to describe it.</p>

	  							<h2 class="h2-sec">Death Benefit</h2>
	  							<p>It is the total amount paid to the nominee by the insurance company if the policyholder dies within the policy term. In most cases, it is the equivalent of the sum assured but may vary based on the payout option chosen at the time of purchasing the policy. The death benefit in insurance plans with riders, on the other hand, can also be more than the base sum assured.</p>

	  				<p>The best time to purchase a term insurance policy is as soon as possible. As you get older, your risks of developing lifestyle diseases rise, as do your insurance expenses.When you get a term plan when you're young, you get an insurance policy with lower premium. Thus, it may be prudent to purchase term life insurance at a young age. In the long term, this will save you a lot of money. Furthermore, it will give you and your family more extended coverage and financial security beginning at a young age.</p><br>

	  				<p>How much term insurance cover you should get is flexible as it all relies on the dependents you have and the premium you can pay. You can get a rough estimate of the cover amount with the help of Human Life Value (HLV). It looks at aspects like your current age and proposed retirement age, current total savings, monthly and future expenditures, kids’ higher education, loans, debts, and so on, and predicts coverage for your family’s financial stability and security in case of your absence. You can also use the insurance coverage calculator to arrive at a rough estimate of the sum assured for your policy.</p><br>
	  				<p>Experts will ask you to go for 10 to 15 times your annual income term plan coverage, although your personal requirements may differ. Some will suggest 15 to 20 times. Whatever be the number, you should consider factors like liabilities, debts, income replacement, insurance for others, etc. These are key to deciding your cover and premium amount</p>

However, buying one at the start of your career has immense benefits. Therefore, rather than waiting, you should purchase a term insurance today. Additionally, the sooner you buy a term insurance, the lesser premium you have to pay, as the amount of the premium increases with age. Moreover, you also have the flexibility to add or remove nominees.Another significant reason to buy a term insurance plan is the tax-saving investment opportunity it offers to the taxpayers. While earning you a life cover, term plan payouts on maturity are also exempt from tax subject to conditions under Section 10(10D).</p>

	  						<p>Generally, the policy tenure starts from 5 years and goes up to a maximum of 45 years. While deciding the term period, you should consider certain factors like loans and debts in your name, the number of dependents, how long your dependents will take to become independent, and the repayment time period for your loans or debts.

  							<h2 class="text-center">WHAT FACTORS CAN AFFECT TERM PLAN PREMIUMS?</h2>
  							<p>The small payments you make when you get term life insurance are known as premiums. Several factors determine the premium. The following factors influence the cost of your term insurance premium:</p>
  						</div>
  					</div>
  					<div class="custom-col-md-6 new-grey-bg  grey_bg long-term-slider red-dots-styles">

	  								<img src="<?php echo base_url()?>assets/eterm/images/e-term-img.png">
	  							</figure>
	  							<h2 class="h2-sec">Age</h2>
	  							<p>For term insurance, your age is critical. The policy's premium is typically lower for young people and rises as they get older. The younger you are, the less likely you are to get an illness that could lead to an unfavorable event, and the lower the risk to the insurer. That is why many financial gurus recommend getting a term insurance policy as early as feasible in life.</p>

	  							</figure>
	  							<h2 class="h2-sec">Gender</h2>
	  							<p>According to numerous scientific studies and research, women live longer than men. According to estimates, the average woman can expect to live five years longer than the average man. And this equates to an additional five years of premiums. As a result, term insurance rates are lower for women as compared to those for men.</p>

	  							</figure>
	  							<h2 class="h2-sec">Profession</h2>
	  							<p>Your profession may play an essential role in your health. People who work in dangerous vocations, such as pilots, sailors, soldiers, and others, are more vulnerable to danger. Because of the complex nature of their job, they are also more susceptible to developing serious illnesses. You will be requested to pay a high premium if your career entails a high level of risk, such as environmental hazards, susceptibility to chemicals, or any other risk.</p>

	  							<h2 class="h2-sec">Current Health Conditions</h2>
	  							<p>Your term insurance premium is affected by factors such as your weight, eating habits, and overall fitness. In addition, if you have hypertension, diabetes, fluctuating blood sugar, thyroid disease, or other health conditions, your premium may be higher.</p>

	  							<h2 class="h2-sec">Medical History</h2>
	  							<p>Premium payments of term plans are frequently determined by your past health issues or those of your family members. Ailments like stroke, heart attack, kidney failure, cancer, and other conditions can be handed down through generations. Therefore, the plan's premium will be relatively high if you or your loved ones, such as your parents or grandparents, suffer from such ailments.</p>

	  							<h2 class="h2-sec">Lifestyle Habits</h2>
	  							<p>If you are interested in adventure activities such as mountain climbing, skydiving, deep-sea diving, or any other adventure sport, you may be requested to pay a higher premium. Because these activities put your life in jeopardy, the premiums are higher.</p>

	  							<h2 class="h2-sec">Smoking and Drinking Alcohol</h2>
	  							<p>Smoking, drinking alcohol, drug use and other related habits can increase your risk of being ill or developing a life-threatening medical condition. As a result, if you do any of these things, you may face a higher term insurance premium. On the other side, if you maintain a healthy lifestyle, your term plan rates may be lower.

  							<p class="mx-400">Financial instruments, such as term insurance plans, are now readily available online thanks to the e-commerce boom. It not only makes the entire process convenient and hassle-free but also saves time and money.</p>
  							<p>Purchasing term life insurance is now easier than ever before:</p>

  						<ol class="term-insure-list new-term-insure">
  							<li>
  								<h4>Examine your requirements:</h4>
  								<p>Your term insurance's sum assured should be sufficient to cover your family's financial commitments in your absence. Most financial consultants recommend the sum assured to be at least 15-20 times your current annual income. Consider the following factors when determining the amount that will suffice:</p>
  								    ● Your current earnings<br>
      								● Number of financially reliant relatives<br>
      								● Existing liabilities, such as mortgages and loans<br>
      								● Funds required to maintain your family's present standard of living<br>
      								● The monthly amount you need to set aside for financial goals such as children’s education.<br>
      								● Inflationary pressures
  							</li>
  							<li>
  								<h4>Choose your insurance provider:</h4>
  								<p>Before purchasing a policy, you should choose a reputable insurance company based on characteristics such as Claim Settlement Ratio, Solvency Ratio, etc.</p>
  							</li>
  							<li>
  								<h4>Determine the premium:</h4>
  								<p>You can use online term plan insurance calculators to figure out how much you'll have to spend for the sum assured you choose.</p>
  							</li>
  							<li>
  								<h4>Provide personal details:</h4>
  								<p>Enter information such as your date of birth, gender, smoking or drinking habits, monthly income, and contact information on the website of the insurance company you choose.</p>
  							</li>
  							<li>
  								<h4>Enter the sum assured and the policy term:</h4>
  								<p>Young applicants should opt for a longer policy term, while middle-aged applicants should go for a shorter policy term. It is so because if you are young, your premium amount will also be less.</p>
  							</li>
  							
  							<li>
  								<h4>Select a payout mode:</h4>
  								<p>Most policies allow you to select between different payout modes like lump-sum, immediate, or increasing recurring payout.</p>
  							</li>
  							<li>
  								<h4>Select add-on benefits or riders:</h4>
  								<p>You may strengthen your family's financial safety net by investing a bit more. If you hold a family history of critical illnesses, you can add a critical illness cover to your term plan. It may be able to assist your family in bearing the high costs of appropriate healthcare. You can also add a death cover rider to your policy. With an accident cover, your family will get additional benefits over and above your death benefit if you pass away in an unfortunate accident.</p>
  							</li>
  							<li>
  								<h4>Fill up the KYC form:</h4>
  								<p>Fill in your full name, address, and phone number. In addition, you'll need to submit proof of identification (a PAN card or an Aadhaar card), proof of address (a driver's license or utility bills), proof of age (a passport), proof of income (tax records), and current passport-sized images. You should also carefully fill out your beneficiary information.</p>
  							</li>
  							<li>
  								<h4>Enter your health details:</h4>
  								<p>You'll need to fill out information like your height, weight, alcohol or cigarette usage history, medical issues (if any), hospitalization history, occupational hazards based on your profession, and other similar details. To avoid your beneficiary's claim being voided in the future, it is advisable to get a medical checkup done to make sure you have your health information.</p>
  							</li>
  							<li>
  								<h4>Read the terms and conditions:</h4>
  								<p>It's critical to understand policy exclusions (if any), such as death caused by natural disasters, terrorist activities, or drug misuse. You will proceed to the payment portal after you have agreed to the terms.</p>
  							</li>
  							<li>
  								<h4>Make the payment:</h4>
  								<p>You can pay with your credit or debit card or using online banking. Once the proposal is approved, you will get a soft copy of the policy via email, while you'll receive the physical copy via mail later.</p>
