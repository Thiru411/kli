	  						<h3>How does Term insurance work?</h3>
	  						<p>Term insurance is a cost-effective life insurance that covers you (policyholder) for a predefined period. It offers substantial financial security to dependents or beneficiaries in your absence by providing them with financial coverage in exchange for regular payments. </p>
							<p>At an elementary level, it involves paying small amounts every month called premiums. Once the policy matures, you receive returns that you may have earned over the years, depending on the type of term insurance policy you chose. You can pay the fixed premiums at once or in instalments over the policy's term or for a specific period. However, one noteworthy fact is that if the policy's tenure ends while you are still alive, then neither you nor your beneficiaries receive any money</p>

 <p><b>Who determines the term insurance premium?</b></p>

 <p>Term insurance premium is calculated by statistics and calculation based on the risk factors. You can calculate the premium of your term plan online based on factors below:</p>

 <ul class="bullet">     <li>Age</li>
    <li>Gender</li>
    <li>Occupation </li>
    <li>Geographical location </li>
    <li>Height and Weight </li>
    <li>Lifestyle habits </li>
    <li>Self-medical history </li>
    <li>Family medical history</li>
</ul>

 <p><b>Why is smoking/nicotine consumption a determinant in term insurance premium calculation?</b></p>

 <p>Smoking or nicotine consumption is a determinant in term policy premium calculation because such products tend to harm the insured. This will make the insured more vulnerable and likely increase the risk of the person filing for a claim. Hence, term insurance plans have a higher premium for smokers.</p>

 <p><b>Can I buy multiple term plans at any given time?</b></p>

 <p>Yes, you can buy multiple term insurance policies at any given time from the same or different insurance provider. Can I use a term plan for wealth creation?</p>

 <p>A term plan is structured only to provide a death benefit and not a return on the investment. The premiums only serve the purpose of providing financial assistance to the family in the absence of the insured. Hence, it is not ideal for wealth creation. However, the family/nominee can use the death benefit to pay off all kinds of expenses or debts.</p>

 <p><b>How to process my term insurance claim?</b></p>

 <p>Affected families or the nominee can file an online term plan claim with minimal documentation as listed below:<br>

 2. Death certificate<br>
 3. Age proof of the insured<br>
 4. Cancelled cheque by the beneficiary<br>
 5. KYC of the beneficiary<br>
 6. Cause-of-death certificate<br>
 7. Post-mortem report and Police FIR for unnatural deaths<br>
 8. Hospital records and confirmation for death due to illness</p>

 <p><b>What happens to the term insurance policy if the policyholder dies?</b></p>

 <p>In case the policyholder dies within the specified period while the term plan is active, the death benefit is paid to the nominee.</p>

 <p><b>What happens to my term plan coverage when the policy term ends?</b></p>

 <p>If the insured has outlived the specified period of the Kotak e-Term insurance, there is no benefit paid, and the policy is terminated.</p>

 <p><b>What happens if the policyholder survives the policy term?</b></p>

 <p>There is no benefit paid in case the policyholder survives the said term of the Kotak e-Term plan. </p>

 <p><b>Will I get any maturity benefit/survival benefit at the end of my policy term?</b></p>

 <p>No, in case of Kotak e-Term plan, there is no cash benefit paid at maturity. The policy provides death benefit at the demise of the insured in the given period.</p>

 <p><b>What if the appointed nominee dies during the policy term?</b></p>

 <p>If the appointed nominee dies, the policyholder can submit the required documentation proof and name a new nominee.</p>
