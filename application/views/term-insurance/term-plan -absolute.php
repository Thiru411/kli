                        <p class="whyYouNeedTerm-subDesc">Premiums for term insurance plans are usually lower compared to other types of life insurance policies. The premium amount is determined based on factors such as your age, health condition, lifestyle habits, policy term, and coverage amount.</p>

                        <p class="whyYouNeedTerm-subDesc">The primary purpose of term insurance is to provide financial protection to your family. In the unfortunate event of your death, the policy ensures that your family does not face financial hardships. The death benefit can be used to cover daily living expenses, children's education, and other essential costs, helping your loved ones maintain their standard of living and achieve their long-term goals. Term insurance offers peace of mind, knowing that your family will be financially secure even in your absence.</p>

                        <p class="whyYouNeedTerm-subDesc">Term insurance can also play a crucial role in protecting your assets. If you have significant financial liabilities such as a home loan, car loan, or personal loans, the death benefit from a term insurance policy can be used to pay off these debts. This ensures that your family is not burdened with debt repayments and can retain ownership of valuable assets like your home or car. By safeguarding your assets, term insurance helps preserve your family's financial stability and legacy.</p>

                        <p class="whyYouNeedTerm-subDesc">Modern lifestyles come with a range of new risks and uncertainties, such as critical illnesses, accidents, and changing economic conditions. Term insurance policies often offer riders and add-ons that provide coverage for these risks. For instance, critical illness riders offer a lump sum payout if you are diagnosed with a serious illness, helping cover medical expenses and loss of income. Accidental death and disability riders provide additional benefits in case of accidental injuries. These supplementary coverages ensure comprehensive protection, allowing you to cope with unexpected challenges without depleting your savings.</p>

                <p class="factorsInfluence-desc">One of the key considerations when purchasing term insurance is the premium, the amount paid by the policyholder to maintain coverage. Understanding the factors that can influence term insurance premiums is crucial for making informed decisions and finding the most suitable coverage at an affordable cost.</p>

                        <p class="factorsInfluence-subDesc">Health is a significant consideration for insurance providers when calculating premiums. Applicants with pre-existing medical conditions or a history of serious illnesses may face higher premiums.</p>

                        <p class="factorsInfluence-subDesc">Age plays a crucial role in term insurance premiums. Younger individuals typically pay lower premiums than older individuals. This is because younger individuals are statistically less likely to develop health issues or pass away during the policy term.</p>

                        <p class="factorsInfluence-subDesc">Insurance providers often consider an individual's lifestyle habits when determining premiums. Certain habits, such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, or drug use, can significantly impact premiums. These habits are associated with higher health risks, leading to increased premiums.</p>

                        <p class="factorsInfluence-subDesc">The nature of one's profession can also affect term insurance premiums. Certain occupations may involve higher risks, such as working in hazardous environments or engaging in dangerous activities.</p>

                        <p class="factorsInfluence-subDesc">The longer the term, the greater the risk for the insurer, as it increases the likelihood of the life insured’s passing away during the policy's duration. Similarly, higher coverage amounts mean greater financial exposure for the insurance company, resulting in higher premiums.</p>
